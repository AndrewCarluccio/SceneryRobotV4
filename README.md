#Fall 2020 Development

This semester, we have made great strides in furthering the development of the robot after COVID-19 halted progress on the physical robot.

We were able to take the work that we did over the spring semester and implement it in the physical robot. The robot can now accuratly give it's location
in an x,y coordinate and angle. 

This data will be crucial going forward as it gives the robot the basis of what it needs to be able to follow a user drawn path. 

For the upcoming semester, our primary goal will be to implement a pursuit algorithm which allows the robot to follow a path given that the robot knows its own 
position and angle. With this algorithm implemented, the robot will be able to follow user defined paths which was our primary goal with the transition to the
raspberry pi platform in the spring of 2020.
